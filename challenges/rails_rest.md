## RAILS: REST Challenge

* Having both the form and the thank-you page in one action is suboptimal.  Restructure the routes and the `home` controller to implement REST.

* Reflect (in your README): You may wish that I had not asked you to restructure the existing `home` controller.  What would you rather have done?
