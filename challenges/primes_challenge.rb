# Write a method which returns the first n primes, where n is provided to the
# method as a parameter.

# Remember that the % operator (modulo) is your friend.  It returns a zero if one
# number is divisible by another number.  In other words, 4 % 2 == 0.

# WRITE YOUR CODE HERE.  Name your method `primes`.
