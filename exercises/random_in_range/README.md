# Random Number in a Range

## Description

Create a method with two parameters: lower and upper.  This method must return a random number between those two numbers.

## Instructions

You are a fisherman who likes to tell stories about the fish you (didn't) catch.  Depending on the species of fish you're bragging about today, you know that there's a lower limit to the length of this fish (if it were shorter, it wouldn't be worth talking about) and there's an upper limit to the length (otherwise there's no way your friends would believe you).  However, you can't give the same length every time you brag about this species (or they'll know you're fibbing a bit).  

You need a method.  You'll give this method a lower limit on the length and an upper limit on the length.  It will give you back a random number in that range.  

You will also need to call this method.  Your code which calls it should use `gets` to ask the user for the fish species, the minimum length, and the maximum length, then call your method and tell the story using `puts`

Write your code in your text editor and save it.
