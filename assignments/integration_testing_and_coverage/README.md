# Integration Testing and Coverage

## Description

Start with the completed project from last week, add extensive integration tests, and check coverage along the way.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should...

* Understand integration testing in Rails
* Understand coverage tools and how to use them

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively...

* Write integration tests on an existing codebase
* Implement SimpleCov on your Rails projects

## Details

### Deliverables

* A link to the repository you worked on over the last weekend, and which now has an extensive suite of integration tests.
* A screenshot of your coverage results.
* A written list of changes you made to your original codebase while adding tests.

### Requirements

Your code should be 100% covered by your test suite (according to SimpleCov).

Your integration tests should include at least one test of each of the following forms:

* Test that BLAH BLAH BLAH
* ...

## Normal Mode

In the same pairs you had over the weekend, add integration tests to your existing project.  Add the SimpleCov gem and continue to test until you reach 100% coverage.  

You may decide along the way that you'd like to change something about the code itself (either because you find a bug or because you see a better way to accomplish something).  This is welcome, and you should write down these changes so that we can discuss them in class.
